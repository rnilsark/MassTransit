MassTransit version 6 is coming soon, and along with it comes new documentation. The new site is built using VuePress, and it is now so much easier to author and publish content. I hope you enjoy the new look, feel, and overall experience. As a bonus, it's easy to submit a PR to update the documentation using the footer link (yes, you could even edit this post).

<!-- more -->

Most of the documentation has been updated to reflect the changes in v6, so if you are using an earlier version, some minor things may be different. You can get a sneak peek at what's coming in version 6 by reading through the [upgrade guide](/getting-started/upgrade-v6).
