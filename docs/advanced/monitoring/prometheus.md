# Prometheus Metrics

[MassTransit.Prometheus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MassTransit.Prometheus)

MassTransit supports Prometheus metric capture, which provides useful observability into the bus, endpoints, consumers, and messages.

> The `prometheus-net` library is used as the Prometheus client since it is mentioned on the Prometheus client list.

### Configuration

To configure the bus to capture metrics, add the `UsePrometheusMetrics()` method to your bus configuration.

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // this registration is simplified
    services.AddMassTransit(x =>
    {
        x.UsingRabbitMq((context, cfg) =>
        {
            cfg.UsePrometheusMetrics(serviceName: "order_service");
        });
    });
}
```

#### Publishing Metrics

Metrics must be available on an HTTP endpoint, by default it is `/metrics`. Add the ASP.NET Core integration package to get this endpoint out-of-the-box.

::: tip
To publish metrics so that they can be scraped by Prometheus, an ASP.NET Core Generic Host is recommended, with the Kestrel HTTP server configured.
:::

```
dotnet add package prometheus-net.AspNetCore
``` 

And then, add the metric server to the application builder.

```cs
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseMetricServer();
}
```
