MassTransit is a free, open-source distributed application framework for .NET. MassTransit makes it easy to create applications and services that leverage message-based, loosely-coupled asynchronous communication for higher availability, reliability, and scalability.

MassTransit works with several well supported message transports and provides an [extensive set of developer-friendly features](usage/transports/) to build durable asynchronous services.
